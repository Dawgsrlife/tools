@escaping.ordinary•1.67M subscribers
Visual Summaries of the Best Books and Ideas :) I like to bring great books and ideas to life in a visual way. I love reading and listening to books, so I want to share with others books and Authors I recommend. My mission for this channel is to get people (especially younger folk) enthusiastic about picking up books more often and mindlessly scrolling through TikTok, IG etc. less often. FAQ What do you use to make the videos? I use everything Adobe, but the main programs I use are -Illustrator -After Effects -Audition -Premier Pro -Photoshop (but not often) Why are you so slow with your content? Everything you see in the video was put together by myself, and they take a longggg time, from reading the book, doing voiceovers, making illustrations, editing etc. I currently have a FT job, but I hope in the future I can go PT and create content more often :)

Most of my videos will focus on often overlooked aspects of driving and owning cars that real petrolheads will appreciate - things like steering feel, how a car rides the road and how much of a smile it can put on your face. I also spend time hunting the best b-roads and country lanes I can find - the right car, on the right road, with the right driver... magic. You'll also hear me giggle a lot. It's a sign I'm enjoying myself :)

Grill Nation

@grillnation•1.1M subscribers
Some of the fondest memories James has grown up with are of the hours his family spent around the grill. Whether it was chicken, burgers or hotdogs they were always favourites of his and his brothers. To the Brown family grilling wasn’t just about food, it was about spending time together, bonding and creating life long memories. It only made sense that after James joined the Navy he would carry on the tradition. James remembered the joy and memories grilling brought him as a child and sought to bring that same atmosphere to his new set of brothers and sisters. In between deployments, James made a point of building camaraderie with his fellow service members from behind the coals of his grill. What started as a hobby for James seemed to have become a career overnight. After the success of his Facebook group, James grew the confidence to start posting his tutorials on Instagram and Tik Tok.

@redeemedzoomer6053•577K subscribers
I am a Presbyterian seminary student training for ministry in the PCUSA, (Presbyterian Church USA) but I completely oppose the theological liberalism that has hijacked it. I have made it my mission to restore it. My theology is Reformed/Calvinist, but I am very ecumenical and open to learning from other Christian traditions. I am a regular gen Z (zoomer) who was raised in a very secular progressive culture. I was once a leftist, but came to know Christ as a teenager which alienated me from my community. I've dedicated all my life since then to learning the things of God and finding creative ways to share what I know with others.

Thank you for visiting my channel. I'm an amateur pianist, husband, father of two, originally from Taiwan, moved to Canada in 1997 and have been here ever since. I almost went into music but ended up in Engineering (now PM). Regardless, piano has always been my passion. I hope to demonstrate that great performances do not require suits/ties/socks/shoes/orbs. By now I should be known for my performance of Animenz arrangements and piano lessons for those. All can be found in my well-organized playlist section. There you'll also find the COMPLETE SquareEnix Piano Collections, including Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, NieR, as well as complete Disney, Ghibli albums, and other VGM/Anime covers. Don't know what to listen to? Just go to "My Personal Favorites" playlist, and you should be impressed. I aim to be as approachable as can be. Don’t feel shy to drop comments or questions, I reply to ALL of them.

I was that student that sat in the back of the classroom bored out of mind, frustrated & not understanding what the teacher was saying. I struggled learning math but in the pursuit to earn my degree, I learned a lot of what it takes to not only absorb the material, but be successful in class. This channel is all about sharing those experiences with you to get you on your path to success. I teach math from the perspective of the struggling student because that was me & it could be you, too. My videos are short, to-the-point and cover everything from Algebra 1 through Calculus.

I'm Tim, a self-taught developer & entrepreneur who brings you educational tech content without the fluff and noise. I went from a broke dropout working at McDonalds to making $100k+/month as a developer, travelling the world and moving to Dubai all before the age of 22. I've since helped thousands of aspiring developers land their first software engineering role and assisted mid-level devs land jobs at companies like google. Max landed his first developer job 3 weeks after going through my training. Youssef was laid off and landed a new role in 2 months while working with me. Jamario landing competing job offers before graduating college. If you want to learn more you can click the first link and watch my free training on how we help developers who already know how to code get hired by top tech companies.

I create Anime/JRPG related videos, generally from smaller games like Neptunia or Azur Lane! Everything here is recorded and edited by me unless provided by a developer . Generally focusing on comparisons or mid to endgame content to give a realistic outlook of game. All videos on the channel are recorded by me into a transformative manner using video editors like Vegas, or WMM, and Audacity rather than full on lets plays or gamemovies. Gameplay is captured via Shadowplay, Gamebar or Elgato HD60+, Guides, Reviews, or first impressions are generally posted in the community tab. Some videos are voiced, ones that aren't usually are subbed or CCd or have pinned comments explaining what's going on.

Best Ever Food Review Show

I travel to unique parts of the world on the hunt for the best food each country has to offer and share these stories with you in my videos. Hey, I’m Sonny! I’m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable wit or enjoyed watching me eat interesting food like sea penis, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. Best Ever Food Review Show is the first food review show exploring the unique foods of each country with a fresh point of view and a punchy delivery, encouraging empathy and understanding of other cultures along the way. From the best street food to the most insane food markets to...well...yes, sea penis, nothing is off limits (except cucumbers. Cucumbers are off limits). I can’t wait to see where this food journey takes us. Don’t forget to subscribe, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!

PiXimperfect, hosted by Unmesh Dinda, is a free resource for learning Photoshop and Lightroom. We believe in learning the concept, rather than learning the steps so that you can translate "your" imagination visually to the world. This will make you a better decision-maker, rather than letting others make decisions for you. Since every situation is different and the definition of "beauty" is subjective, it is essential that you master the approach, and then the steps will automatically follow. Our motto is "Keep Creating." We always say to our students: "Don't worry so much about the quality, because time will improve it. Don't spend so much time getting things pixel-perfect, so that you end up not finishing it. Just 'Keep Creating,' and your consistency will take care of the rest." PiXimperfect is free, and will always be. ► Support the cause: https://pix.live/patreon

What looks better, a car with simple tasteful modifications? Or a car with a giant wing and a brightly painted trim? I am not the Gordon Ramsey of Cars, but you don't need to be a great chef to know if food stinks. Just like i don't need to be a master technician to know if a car is an ugly fail or if its a slow ricer. Ricers are cars that appear to be fast through the addition of sporty wings and non functional vents, but don't have the engine power to back it up. The word ricer actually stands for Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancements and/or Really Immature Car Enthusiast, both of which usually come in a package deal. Tuners on the other hand are on the other side of the spectrum. Tuners Modify their cars with performance parts in order to try to achieve their cars maximum potential either for drifting, drag racing, or even track use. Tuner cars are usually tastefully modified on the exterior as well. Cameraman: Alma Mujica

Salim Ahmed

@DoctorSalimAhmed•150K subscribers
Hey, I'm Salim! I'm a medical doctor based in London, UK. I've always been somebody who enjoyed learning and improving - I've been teaching myself how to play the piano for over 12 years, taught myself Japanese and got qualified, regularly go gym, and have an undergraduate, postgraduate, and medical degree - and now I'm a doctor. It's all helped me develop healthy habits and become productive with my time. So, I share what's helped me over the years to go from the normal guy who struggled to get things done, to now being consistent and having the discipline to be productive and do what's truly good for me; whether that's in academics, or in my personal life - so I hope I can inspire a positive change in you too! Upload every 1-2 weeks. For business enquiries, feel free to contact me via email. Otherwise, leave a comment in my videos - I almost always reply!

The come up: What's going on everyone my name is Joe but on the Internet I go by ComboDombo or simply put, Combi. I started youtube back in 2013 as a kid who enjoyed playing minecraft with friends from school. What turned out as a casual fun thing to do, turned out to be much more than that. I was blessed with the opportunity to meet so many amazing people around the world, and create many memories that I won't ever forget. My alias has basically been cemented into Minecraft because of such an awesome community that enjoyed my content at a young age. Now: What you can expect on my channel moving forward is mostly going to be gaming, vlog, and comedy related. If you are new here on the channel I welcome you and appreciate you taking the time out of your day to check out my content. That is all, if you're chillin make sure to subscribe aii!

Hi everyone! I started learning piano as an adult back in June 2017, and it has become a huge passion of mine. So much so, that I'm now studying Music at University. My main goal with this channel is provide helpful content for aspiring pianists, and provide an insight into how I approach piano playing as a late learner. My biggest love is for classical piano music, despite wanting to learn piano primarily because of video game piano music. So if that's your thing please subscribe, as I plan to post performances of classical and video game pieces from time to time too! I hope to connect with my fellow pianists here on YouTube and spread the love for this amazing music with you. Whatever age you are, it's not too late to start.

channel update!!! I'm working on a big game show series called "Social Circle" that will take quite a while to finish. below is a synopsis: Inspired by The Genius, "Social Circle" is a last-man-standing strategy game show where 13 players play a series of strategic, social, and psychological games, eliminating one player per episode until only one remains. It's played in Minecraft using proximity voice to simulate a real-world environment, but the strategy games themselves do not involve Minecraft mechanics in any way. I will not upload any videos until this series is done, which will likely be around late 2026. I really think it'll be worth the wait, so thank you everyone for being patient! and thank you everyone who has watched my videos. except more updates about social circle around 1-2 months before it releases. if you want to testwatch the series before it releases, please add/message me on discord @honmi and I'll reach out to you when I'm ready for testwatching (~august 2025)

BUT you must give me the appropriate credit by mentioning my artist name (Lukrembo) and the track title somewhere in your video description. Before using any of my music tracks in your videos, I highly recommend that you read the FAQs on my record label Free To Use Music's website (https://freetousemusic.com/faq/) If you are a private person or working on behalf of a company, and you wish to use any of my music tracks without having to give credit and/or for commercial purposes (e.g. company video, advertisement, podcast, social media post, or another media format), then you will need to purchase a license from this shop: https://freetousemusic.com/shop

When I watched him I was just blown away by the amount of skill he had in his possession. (First video of his I enjoyed was his Cleveland Brown series) He inspired me to want to do it online and so I did I started about 10 years ago just going in Call of Duty lobbies doing stupid voice impressions and found out my true passion which was making people laugh over the internet by doing these stupid silly voices of mine. My favorite VA is Steve Blum His story is Just the best to me and Overall my Favorite Voice Actor. If you enjoyed anything I said hope you stay to see where we take this channel to.

The Actors Academy
@TheActorsAcademy•379K subscribers
10 Hour Online Acting Course (Get Instant Access!) https://the-actors-academy.teachable.com Welcome to The Actors Academy! I sought out my acting training from professionals working in the industry today. I wanted to get the best acting training I could, so I eventually ended up with private instruction from coaches who had attended Juilliard, Harvard, Yale, RADA, A.C.T, and coaches who'd never gone to drama school. I wanted to get the best all-around training I could find. I gained so much knowledge on acting that I began to realize how easy it really was. Trust me though, I didn't think that in the beginning. You could have looked at me and assumed my acting wouldn't have amounted to anything, but with perseverance and dedication, I found and received world-class training. My goal is to make acting easy/simple and to throw out all the nonsense that we really don't need. ..................................................... -----INQUIRIES----- TheActorsAcademyLA@gmail.com

TVFilthyFrank

@TVFilthyFrank•7.82M subscribers
Filthy Frank is the embodiment of everything a person should not be. He is anti-PC, anti-social, and anti-couth. He behaves and reacts excessively to everything expressly to highlight the ridiculousness of racism, misogyny, legalism, injustice, ignorance and other social blights. He also sets an example to show how easy it is in the social media for any zany material to gain traction/followings by simply sharing unsavoury opinions and joking about topics many find offensive.There is no denying that the show is terribly offensive, but this terrible offensiveness is a deliberate and unapologetic parody of the whole social media machine and a reflection of the human microcosm that that social media is. OR MAYBE IM JUST FUCKING RETARDED.

Hi, my name is Darlene and I'm a Vietnamese Canadian self taught portrait artist. This channel is for anything artsy that I want to share with the world (speed drawings, tutorials, reviews and other art entertainment content). Although I'm still learning how to draw, I like to share my knowledge to help and encourage others. It took me many years and a lot of trial and error to learn how to draw, so I try my best to make drawing tutorials that are easy to understand and apply. I strongly believe anyone can learn, as long as: - they have the right attitude - they learn from the right teacher(s) who fit their specific learning style - they have/develop good observation skills - they apply good practice You can find free tutorials on my channel and a lot more on my website (rapidfireart.com). If you're a complete beginner, check out my FREE drawing course: http://rapidfireart.com/how-to-draw-for-beginners/ (Don't worry, I won't even ask for your email) Darlene

Riding motorcycles, Kawasaki sport bikes, Harley Davidson or anything on two wheels, and motovlogging about riding them, is what I love to do. Explaining how to ride, stoppie, drift or how to do burnouts on your bike, is what I love to do! Riding, racing, group rides, drifting, motorcycles, or street riding with motorcycle insurance, gasoline in the tank, and new tires on the bikes! Currently on a 2004 636 Kawasaki Ninja street bike, a 2009 Harley 1200, and a Honda Grom! If you like cool motovlogs and a fun new taste on the sport bike scene, you have come to the right channel for all your motorcycle questions and how to videos! Being a moto vlogger that pushes the limits on bikes is all part of the lifestyle! brian_636 has been on bikes all over the United States of America and has close ties with some of the best out there from Streetfighterz, CBear, to others like TheKilaCam, Imkay, and many more riders from across the Streets of America!

Lukas Pank
@pankracing•34.7K subscribers
Hi everyone! My name is Lukas Pank. I'm 26 years old and I've been racing cars since I was 14 and go-karts since I was 7 or so. I do motorsports as a hobby with my dad and I love everything about it. Over the years I've learned so much about the sport and what it takes to be a racing driver. My goal is to bring the otherwise unnoticed details of car racing to anyone that wouldn't have known otherwise. I want to show people, that know nothing about car racing, what the sport is really about and why I enjoy it so much. As many people in the motorsports world would agree, racing cars is like a chess game played at 150+ mph. Its a battle that requires skill, endurance, strategy, synergy, comradery, logistics, and always a bit of luck that begins well before the green flag drops.

I’m a specialty coffee enthusiast who loves tasty coffees and tinkering with coffee and espresso gear. My perspective in the coffee industry is as the middle-man between the most dedicated coffee nerds, and regular people who drink regular coffee. I love presenting concepts and brewing practices that are trending in the coffee scene, and explaining them in a way that the everyday coffee-enjoyer can understand. Specialty coffee is a growing hobby for many, but some still view it as a bland commodity. I’m hoping that you can see it from a different perspective through my videos.

Capturing the natural beauty of chemistry I find that chemistry is often taught poorly or without a purpose. Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. In each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to capture the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways. In terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab, and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel. Now, making chemistry videos has become my full-time job! Sponsorships and related business inquiries: nilered@endcard.com Other inquiries: admin@nilered.ca

Mick Drives Cars
@MickDrivesCars•214K subscribers
This is a car driving and review channel. I love driving anything fun, fast and interesting. Most of my videos will focus on often overlooked aspects of driving and owning cars that real petrolheads will appreciate - things like steering feel, how a car rides the road and how much of a smile it can put on your face. I also spend time hunting the best b-roads and country lanes I can find - the right car, on the right road, with the right driver... magic. You'll also hear me giggle a lot. It's a sign I'm enjoying myself :)
